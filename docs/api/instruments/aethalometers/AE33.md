## Data Format

- File format: Tab-delimited text file (.dat)
- Sampling frequency: 1 minute
- File naming pattern: `[!ST|!CT|!FV]*[!log]_AE33*.dat`
    - log file is not included ex. AE33_log_AE33-S05-00494_20220401.dat
- Header: 5 rows of header information
- Data columns: 67 columns including timestamp and measurements

## Measurement Parameters

The AE33 provides black carbon concentration measurements at seven wavelengths:

- BC1-BC7: Black carbon concentrations at different wavelengths (ng/m³)

## Data Processing

### Data Reading

- Automatically skips the first 5 rows of header information
- Parses timestamps from date and time columns (columns 0 and 1)
- Extracts black carbon concentration data for seven wavelengths
- Strips semicolons from column names
- Validates file size (warns if < 550KB)

### Quality Control

1. Instrument Status Check:
    - Filters data based on instrument status codes:
        - Status = 1: Tape advance (tape advance, fast calibration, warm-up)
        - Status = 2: First measurement – obtaining ATN0
        - Status = 3: Stopped
        - Status = 4: Flow low/high by more than 0.5 LPM or F1 < 0 or F2/F1 outside 0.2 – 0.75 range
        - Status = 16: Calibrating LED
        - Status = 32: Calibration error (at least one channel OK)
        - Status = 384: Tape error (tape not moving, end of tape)
        - Status = 1024: Stability test
        - Status = 2048: Clean air test
        - Status = 4096: Optical test
    - Removes data points with other status codes indicating instrument problems

2. Value Range Check:
    - Removes physically impossible values (negative or > 20000 ng/m³)

3. Data Representativeness:
    - Requires at least 50% of expected data points in each 1-hour window
    - Ensures temporal consistency of measurements

4. Complete Record Requirement:
    - Ensures data completeness across all wavelengths

## Output Data

The processed data contains the following columns:

- Time index: Data acquisition time
- BC1-BC7: Black carbon concentrations at seven wavelengths (ng/m³)

## Notes

- The AE33 provides real-time black carbon concentration measurements, useful for distinguishing between biomass burning
  and fossil fuel combustion contributions
- Files smaller than 550KB may indicate incomplete data
- Supports data filtering based on instrument status codes
- Handles duplicate timestamps and invalid indices automatically
