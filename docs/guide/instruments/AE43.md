# AE43 Aethalometer

The AE43 is a multi-wavelength aethalometer used for measuring black carbon aerosol concentrations in the atmosphere.

## Data Format

- File format: CSV file
- Sampling frequency: 1 minute
- File naming pattern: `[!ST|!CT|!FV]*[!log]_AE43*.dat`
- Timestamp column: StartTime
- Configuration tracking: Uses SetupID for configuration management

## Measurement Parameters

The AE43 provides black carbon concentration measurements at seven wavelengths:

- BC1-BC7: Black carbon concentrations at different wavelengths (ng/m³)

## Data Processing

### Data Reading

- Parses timestamps from the StartTime column
- Automatically identifies and selects the latest configuration data (SetupID)
- Extracts black carbon concentration data for seven wavelengths
- Groups data by SetupID to handle configuration changes
- Includes Status column for quality control

### Quality Control

1. Instrument Status Check:
    - Filters data based on instrument status codes:
        - Status = 1: Tape advance (tape advance, fast calibration, warm-up)
        - Status = 2: First measurement – obtaining ATN0
        - Status = 3: Stopped
        - Status = 4: Flow low/high by more than 0.5 LPM or F1 < 0 or F2/F1 outside 0.2 – 0.75 range
        - Status = 16: Calibrating LED
        - Status = 32: Calibration error (at least one channel OK)
        - Status = 384: Tape error (tape not moving, end of tape)
        - Status = 1024: Stability test
        - Status = 2048: Clean air test
        - Status = 4096: Optical test
    - Removes data points with other status codes indicating instrument problems

2. Value Range Check:
    - Removes physically impossible values (negative or > 20000 ng/m³)

3. Data Representativeness:
    - Requires at least 50% of expected data points in each 1-hour window
    - Ensures temporal consistency of measurements

4. Complete Record Requirement:
    - Ensures data completeness across all wavelengths

## Output Data

The processed data contains the following columns:

- Time index: Data acquisition time
- BC1-BC7: Black carbon concentrations at seven wavelengths (ng/m³)

## Notes

- The AE43 provides real-time black carbon concentration measurements, useful for distinguishing between biomass burning
  and fossil fuel combustion contributions
- Supports data filtering based on instrument status codes
- Automatically handles configuration changes and duplicate timestamps
- Maintains data integrity across configuration changes using SetupID
