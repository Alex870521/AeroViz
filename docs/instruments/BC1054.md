# Multi-wavelength Aethalometer (BC1054)

The BC1054 is a multi-wavelength aethalometer that measures black carbon concentrations at up to ten different
wavelengths.

## Data Format

- File format: CSV file
- Sampling frequency: Variable
- File naming pattern: `*.csv`
- Data structure:
    - Datetime index
    - BC1-BC10 columns with units (ng/m続)
    - Status column for instrument state

## Measurement Parameters

The BC1054 provides black carbon measurements:

- BC1-BC10: Black carbon concentrations at different wavelengths (ng/m続)

## Data Processing

### Data Reading

- Processes CSV files with datetime index
- Standardizes column names
- Maps to consistent BC1-BC10 format
- Filters based on instrument status codes
- Handles duplicate timestamps

### Quality Control

1. Instrument Status Check:
    - Filters data based on instrument status codes:
        - Status = 1: Power Failure
        - Status = 2: Digital Sensor Link Failure
        - Status = 4: Tape Move Failure
        - Status = 8: Maintenance
        - Status = 16: Flow Failure
        - Status = 32: Automatic Tape Advance
        - Status = 64: Detector Failure
        - Status = 256: Sensor Range
        - Status = 512: Nozzle Move Failure
        - Status = 1024: SPI Link Failure
        - Status = 2048: Calibration Audit
        - Status = 65536: Tape Move
    - Removes data points with other status codes indicating instrument problems

2. Value Range Check:
    - Removes physically impossible values:
        - Negative concentrations
        - Values > 20000 ng/m続

3. Data Representativeness:
    - Requires at least 50% of expected data points in each 1-hour window
    - Ensures temporal consistency of measurements

4. Complete Record Requirement:
    - Ensures data completeness across all wavelengths
    - Removes duplicate consecutive rows to prevent data redundancy

## Output Data

The processed data contains:

- Time index: Data acquisition time
- BC1-BC10: Black carbon concentrations at each wavelength
- All measurements in ng/m続

## Notes

- Provides real-time multi-wavelength measurements
- Enables detailed source apportionment
- Supports up to 10 wavelength channels
- Automatic tape advance system
- Status-based quality control
