# MA350 Aethalometer

The MA350 is an advanced aethalometer that measures black carbon concentrations at multiple wavelengths and provides
source apportionment between fossil fuel and biomass burning sources.

## Data Format

- File format: CSV file
- Sampling frequency: Variable
- File naming pattern: `*.csv`
- Data structure:
    - Datetime index from 'Date / time local' column
    - BC measurements at multiple wavelengths
    - Source apportionment data
    - Derived parameters

## Measurement Parameters

The MA350 provides:

- Black carbon measurements at five wavelengths:
    - UV (BC1)
    - Blue (BC2)
    - Green (BC3)
    - Red (BC4)
    - IR (BC5)
- Source apportionment:
    - Biomass burning BC mass (BB mass)
    - Fossil fuel BC mass (FF mass)
- Derived parameters:
    - Delta-C (UV-IR difference)
    - AAE (Absorption Ångström Exponent)
    - BB (Biomass burning percentage)

## Data Processing

### Data Reading

- Processes CSV files with specific header structure
- Standardizes column names
- Maps wavelength-specific measurements
- Handles datetime parsing
- Converts measurements to numeric format

### Quality Control

1. Instrument Status Check:
    - Filters data based on instrument status codes:
        - Status = 1: Power Failure
        - Status = 2: Start up
        - Status = 4: Tape advance
        - Status = 16: Optical saturation
        - Status = 32: Sample timing error
        - Status = 128: Flow unstable
        - Status = 256: Pump drive limit
        - Status = 2048: System busy
        - Status = 8192: Tape jam
        - Status = 16384: Tape at end
        - Status = 32768: Tape not ready
        - Status = 65536: Tape transport not ready
        - Status = 262144: Invalid date/time
        - Status = 524288: Tape error
    - Removes data points with other status codes indicating instrument problems

2. Value Range Check:
    - Removes physically impossible values:
        - Negative concentrations
        - Values > 20000 ng/m³

3. Data Representativeness:
    - Requires at least 50% of expected data points in each 1-hour window
    - Ensures temporal consistency of measurements

4. Complete Record Requirement:
    - Ensures data completeness across all channels
    - Validates source apportionment calculations

## Output Data

The processed data contains:

- Time index: Data acquisition time
- BC1-BC5: Black carbon at each wavelength (ng/m³)
- BB mass: Biomass burning BC (ng/m³)
- FF mass: Fossil fuel BC (ng/m³)
- Delta-C: UV-IR difference (ng/m³)
- AAE: Absorption Ångström Exponent
- BB: Biomass burning percentage (%)

## Notes

- Provides real-time source apportionment
- Distinguishes between fossil fuel and biomass burning
- Multi-wavelength measurement capability
- Advanced data quality control
- Source-specific mass concentrations
